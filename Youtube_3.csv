2;every human being must be treated equally.  gender inequality is real.  imagine the possibilities if all genders were treated equally,  if all children received proper education regardless of their gender. I think it would be a much advanced and prosperous world. think about it.;0;1;0;0
3;The sad thing is my own mom... she differences between me and her 2 sons. Those little things she does... its not something that big but when they start to happen everyday... its what hurts the most. My eldest brother shouts at my mom and she just gets scared of him instead of scolding him. These things made me feel suicidal. I tried to commit suicide 2 times by eating alot of sleeping pills but... somehow I woke up the next morning. There is just so much I would like to share but... its ok :'( BTW... I am only 15 y/o rn so plz ignore my grammar;0;0.5;1;0
4;MALALA IS  ICON. My class learnt about her and we are all only year 6 But this is great that we learn about this. It needs to be heard. 20 of the kids on my class are boys so this is wonderful. Spread woman rights.;1;1;0;0

11;I am 74-years old, and a retired rock musician, having toured the entire country.  I have lived through everything from the civil rights movement, to the Free Love and the LSD years of the Swingin' Sixties, to Women's Lib, and even burned my draft card during the Vietnam War, fully willing to face the consequences of that.  Many of my best friends are black, gay and lesbian. ;0;0;0;0

13;Can someone please tell me where to find the speech of malala?;0;0;0;0
14;Damn this was so true..... Until women were able to sexually harass guys like it's nothing and guys get brutally punished for doing the same thing;0;0.5;0.5;0.5
15;When you hear about all the feelings it is no wonder that men have constructed the world as women stayed home.     Each has a place.  Each has strengths and weaknesses.    Together they can be strong.  Separated they will destroy society.   That is the path we are on now.;0;0.5;1;0.5
16;Do you know In Tamil Nadu, India 2021 Assembly Elections, One party is fielding 50% Woman candidates. First in India. Can you talk about it if you are really in to woman rights.;0;1;0;0
17;"in my opinion, we are not working with social equality when we talk about work, opportunities, rights and others, because with a world so ""evolved"" we should have equality of simple things.  Women have already been neglected, demoted all because they were only born with a vagina, so from the same people we have 2 kidneys, 2 lungs, we have the same rights";0;1;0.5;0
18;It's sad how many comments are here belittling the suffering that women go through, refusing to acknowledge it.;0;1;0;0
19;No one should be treated differently no matter their gender, ethnicity, skin colour, or your sexuality. We're all human and we should all be treated equally. No one should be treated less than and everyone deserves the same rights. Yes people will always have different beliefs but when it comes to basic human rights and everyone being treated equally everyone should have the same opinion.;0;1;0;0
20;The first speeches are just emotional without any facts.;0;0;0;0
21;Lmao, âwomen are not treated as the same as men, in most cases even better than men.;0;0;1;1
22;Every person who speaks out against gender equality are the best;0;0;1;1
23;Everyone : Women's rights;0.5;0.5;0;0
24;Isn't it hypocritical for powerful women to lecture on these issues, the hypocrisy of the left;0;0;1;0
25;27;0;0;0;0
26;Everyone should have the same rights, it's like going back in to the 1930 and having  segregation. We should all have the same rights;0;1;0;0
27;So many of these women lost big time due to their ego and condescension.;0;0;1;0

36;I speak a little English, I want to help you. I cannot remember my name or the name of my daughter or the city of protecting my daughter. I also protected myself. I left Africa after the death of a husband to Arab countries. I gave birth to my first daughter after my daughter was ten years old. I married an Arab man and had two children. My daughter lived with her father's family until she was thirteen years old   Then she lived with me;0;0;0;0
37;Men and women are equal!;0;1;0;0
38;Oh, so you got to be a woman to have rights that is fucked up, how about us men? Oh yeah that's right we get prison time for life;0;0;1;1
39;The grain of salt for taking this should be humongous: politicians and celebrities are well known to throw lot of BS.;0;0;1;0
40;It's not 'equally' that I want. What I want is  not treating one group of people better than another in society+ jobs, social groups/interactions, and so forth. I don't want to be the one most blamed in a court room for a crime like men tend to be- since woemn tend to be less likely judged or accused of a crime. I would rather us, male and female be different, and yet both men and females have a chance to be seen as people, not as dangerous/evil patriarchy, or as pretty obedience props. I think there is just prejudice against all groups of people no matter who you are, so I tend to struggle with feminism. ;0;0.5;1;1
41;We really need more female lumberjacks and brick layers.  Make it happen ladies!!;1;1;0;0
42;According to these prominent , very successful women, it would appear that women can't catch a break ever.0;0.5;0.5;0;

47;0:26 oh my god;0;0;0;0
48;I am not even sure if this is sarcasm or not.;0;0;0;0
49;I'm still waiting for women to built a city and their own economy but I'm 44yo Im guessing I won't see it;0;0;1;0
50;1:45 technically if we (man) don't have a say in it then thats not true equality it's very close but not all the way there;0;0;0.5;1
51;My point of view on this and story: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0HRvkRTePs;0;0;0;0
52;Bro thereâ€™s been literally no facts or anything lmfao. Just literally them saying make women equal. Bruh you're at least equal in fact because of all of this kind of idea men are treated Inequally because people are scared to not please women if you get what I mean.;0;0;1;1
53;This Video is Eyeopening. I am presenting a video On Women Empowerment in Youtube. Could I use some of clip from your Video. Kindly Advise.;1;1;0;0

58;Stfu , i miss the 1900 , good old days :(;0;0;1;0
59;I don't understand how women in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, etc....are still complaining about gender inequality?   Especially from all these successful women.   How are women not equal in western countries?   The wage gap is not true and very misleading, there are more women in college than men.   CEOs?   A lot of CEOs started the company....so what's stopping women from starting a business?   There are even special loans specific for women or minorities.   Where is all this supposed oppression?    The woman who got shot for wanting to go to school, or like where women aren't allowed to drive, etc......yes, support  feminist trying to help those woman.   But in the West?   Women have the same opportunities as men.   Women are offended favored in some areas.   Do what you want.....as long as standards are not lowered based on your gender.....go for it, and stop constantly complaining.;0;0.5;1;1
60;First...the indias...has to learn to speak in english, and spanish... and learn to be placed... Incredible those3 who like to be heared, whithout knwoledge...;0;0;1;0

77;Hahaha there are more dislikes then likes;0;0;0;0
78;can i use ur video;0;0;0;0
79;0:10 yea in today's time womens are treat with such equality and justice that people just forget men's equality rights. If a man harasses a women -thats a big issue If a women harasses a man- society does not even care. This is dogshit;0;0;1;1
80;The first woman came from a man...just a reminder.;0;0;1;0

83;Gross;0;0;1;0
84;Wow just wow this makes me want to throw up. I'm a female and everybody should know that it takes a man and a woman to make a child. Men should have a say in whether or not their child is born. And if y'all are so for women's rights you should be against abortion because It kill so many women they don't have a choice if they live or die.;0;0.5;0.5;0
