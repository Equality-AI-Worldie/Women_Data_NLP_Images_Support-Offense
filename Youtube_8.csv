1;People say that being a feminist is a bad thing because they want power over men thatâ€™s not true itâ€™s being EQUAL to men. And feminist do not hate men they are talking about how they are treated compared to men it has nothing to do with hating them!;0;1;0;0

7;"Denial of equality... ""The denial of such equality perpetrates an injustice against one half of the worldâ€™s population and promotes in men harmful attitudes and habits that are carried from the family to the workplace, to political life, and ultimately to international relations.

16;Somehow sexism is seen as more acceptable than racism. You would never see any of these comments towards a Black rights video that these hateful men have wrote towards women on this video.;0;1;0;0
17;It breaks my heart, even if the USA still has problems regarding gender equality (example, how unprotected victims of sexual abuse are), it is MAGNITUDES better than most countries where women are beaten, abused, and seen as second class citizens. Like in Russia where domestic abuse is rampant, Japan where sexual assault is not taken seriously, Saudi Arabia where women literally have to depend on a man for all of their lifeâ€™s, and I could go on and on. On most countries, being a feminist is a red stamp on the forehead of a woman, marking her as crazy. Women donâ€™t deserve this, and it honestly makes me so sad.;1;1;0;0

He started too bother me soo much that I had too block him. After he started too create many accounts too bother me. In the game he told everybody bad things about me soo nobody talked too me. In his head, only he would talk with me. When I said things in the game chat, it was only him too answer. I quit that game because of him. I submited tickets too report him. GoT Devs did nothing.

43;I would like to point out that if people are pro-life then there are actually better laws for them to change that would save lives. For example, organ transplants save lives. However, there aren't a lot of donors. Legally, you can't take life-saving organs from a dead body without their permission.;0;0;0;0
