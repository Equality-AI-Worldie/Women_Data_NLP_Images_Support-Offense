Also, everywhere you look says he wrote and directed A Quiet Place, but two other (lesser known) dudes actually came up with the story and all three of them are listed as screenwriters. Maybe they made a deal to give Krasinski a writing credit to lend their script a big name to garner some attention from producers? “Oh wow, Krasinski can act, write, and direct?! Triple threat!
