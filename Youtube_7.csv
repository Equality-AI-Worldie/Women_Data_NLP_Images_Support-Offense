1;This needs more views! She explains the problems of both sides and does without any bias. Absolutely love her speech!;1;0;0;0
"2""Like it or not, she is spitting straight facts""";1;1;0;0;
3;I liked it: â€œWomen donâ€™t just become mothers â€“ people become parentsâ€ . Indeed, â€œdad confidenceâ€ and â€œdad guiltâ€ also do exist.;0;1;0;0
4;I, as a man, can only dream of a day when I have the same and equal reproductive and parental rights with a woman.;0;1;0;0
5;This makes so much sense. I look forward to seeing more discussion around addressing the needs of everyone in the workplace instead of being separated into different groups.;0;0;0;0
6;I think it is very important that men and women have the same opportunities regardless of their different abilities and skills, it is difficult to achieve but it all depends on people changing their perspectives on the opposite gender;0;1;0;0
7;thank f*ing god there is some sense;0;0;0;0
8;As a man I believe that one day we wonâ€™t be called sexist when a woman hurts you in a physical way;0;0;0.5;1
9;There are two types of people in our world. People who are old fashioned and People with modern values. Some of the old fashion people pretend to be into gender equality because they want more than they already get. For example women who demand that the men be providers while not having to do anything for the man (because equality). Closet old fashioned people confuse the issue. Then you have people who think they are for equality but then still have some old fashioned values. Equality just means you do unto others as they do unto you. It is all about individuality rather then basing who someone is on gender.;0;1;1;1
10;What a really fresh perspective on what could be a sensitive topic. I really enjoyed this talk. Thanks for sharing.;0;0;0;0
11;Boomers are getting smarter in politics;0;0;0;0
12;I think it has several points in favor, since it thinks in an equality way and that brings benefits for both mens and womens.;0;0;0;0
13;This issue is extremely important, since the reality of things is like that, the value of women and men are mutual, and in the workplace they are both of vital importance. We discuss this topic in class for this day;0;1;0;0
14;OMG a rational talk on gender!  It's probably a bit much to hope that someone will look into the law courts next and see the disparities there!;0;0;0;0
15;Entertaining, thought provoking and amusing. Also love them shoes x;0;0;0;0
16;Men and women are different.;0;0;1;0
17;Amazing talk;0;0;0;0
18;So important that this is on the agenda. I've seen the tension in action in some of my clients. and you're right  people become parents. Thought provoking and well delivered.;1;0;0;0
19;This talk touches on really important points of gender equality. It is crucial to say it out loud that as human beings we face the same struggles in life. But it is society that tells us how we should react and feel. As  Caroline said there's no difference in women's and men's confidence, mum's and dad's guilt. As members of the society we should acknowledge the issue and move forward.;0;1;0;0
20;Applaudable talk!;0;0;0;0
21;This is beautiful, thank you Caroline;1;0;0;0
22;This is what I needed. I needed someone to argue my point! I've been trying to tell the people that I know for so long and now I can show them this!;0;0;0;0
23;I am wondering why this video have only this much of views. Every other tedx talks have millions of views. The idea she brought up in this video should be known by everyone.;1;0;0;0
24;YouTube speaks more about my reality than email;0;0;0;0
25;This is an amazing TedTalkÉ;0;0;0;0
26;"This entire Ted talk could've just been the title and you could've ended it with a ""thanks for coming to my Ted talk""";0;0;0;0
27;It is of utmost importance what caroline mentions in this video, the point of view she has about male power in certain labor camps. But we must bear in mind that there are people, not simply men, who are better at some things that another person could not handle.;0.5;1;0;0
28;I love this speech is really eye opening;0;0;0;0
29;Brilliant talk Caroline and one that I hope will be shared widely by company founders, board members, HR directors, L&D consultants, etc and used as an opportunity to discuss the situation with everyone (men and women together) in their own business.;1;0.5;0;0
30;I Think that This is a great video because we can find several points, in conclusion a woman can find the same oportunities as a men they have their diferent abilities that makes them diferent and unique;1;1;0;0
31;Great talk, excellent and thought provoking content, beautifully delivered  :-);1;0;0;0
32;Interesting! The video portray boys as lazy, incapable of doing their homework and are only interested in play games. This perception is dangerous as more boys listening to the video may take it for granted that it is characteristic of all boys. Besides, it might make girls be proud of themselves thinking they are better than boys.;0;0;1;1
33;"I agree when she talked about ""women dont just become mothers but people become parents"" and that she said the every  society needs both points of view to have bigger progress Itz for my english class";1;1;0;0
34;Love it, Caroline. Confidence, Childcare and Capability are essential for all of us. Your delivery is brilliant as ever. Thank you for taking the time to research and respect the importance of both men and women in our collective efforts toward gender equality.;1;1;0;0
35;This intrigues me and I appreciate it. I am a Auto Body Tech and everything in this talk is completely true. The women in the trades band wagon is seen as the easiest promotion gimmick and even I'm getting sick of it. Show off the skill, not the gender. Thank you for giving this Talk!;1;0;0;0
36;she's a truely intelligent person;1;0;0;0
37;I agree with with her specially when she said she went to go have dinner with his colleague when she said that every society needs the point of view of all genders so they could have a bigger progress.   It's for my English class;1;0;0;0
38;Brilliant, impactful and timely talk... this is definitely something that should be discussed more!;0;0;0;0
39;Lost for words Caroline.  Dee and I watched this together and this definitely touched a raw nerve.  You're raising so many important issues in this, equal parental leave is something I wish every company would consider.  Kudos on an amazing, inspiring talk.;1;1;0;0
40;#1 They aren't required to register for the draft... Why, if they're equal?;0;0;0;0
41;I think both genders have a lot going against them.;0;1;0;1
42;I'm a 25 girl, unmarried, and was very happy about this until I realized the down side.;0;0;0;0
43;"There's this social stigma that men are just confident in themselves and don't deal with that nagging self doubt because ""oh men have it easy"" let me just say, I am a man, and I recently bid on a job to move up in my company. Not even a big leap. It was literally to the next step, the first true full time position in the company ladder. And the entire 2 weeks it took for them to pick a person for that position. I was extremely stressed ""oh I should have also put in for the afternoon shift because what if they don't pick me because they had one other person and then The afternoon shift gets a new hire to fill it."" And ""they won't pick me because I'm young and there's this female worker who probably also wants full time and is pretty good too""";0;0;0;1
44;"This is such a good video and another point to add would be that often times women do not get promoted to higher positions because people think that they will not be able to be 100% reliable because they are a mom but if both men and women got the same paid time leave then there would not be that big of a bias against ""working moms"" which as she said shouldn't be a term necessarily when working dads isn't a term.";0;1;0;0
45;Glad to hear a balanced conversation!;0;0;0;0
46;"Equality and feminism exists until you need to haul the fridge up the 7th floor and the elevator is broken. ""CHANGE MY MIND""";0;0;1;1
47;I didn't get a DP position because I am a white male. I was told secretly afterwards by an aide to the admin doing the hiring.  Admin was explicitly told that they had to hire a non-white non-Christian female.;0;0;0;0
48;Being has a tendency to 'return' to clusters ='the nature of solidarity' -a desire for empathy -(Wave)-(yin);0;0;0;0
49;Equality is good. More Brick layers,Carpet layers,Plumber,Roofers,Road Worker. How many are in this Industry.;0;0;0;0
50;When are we going to see equal.opportunities for men? What do we mean by equal opportunities? The usual interpretation is men and women having equal access to the opportunities that exist. But that is not all there is to it, is it? If we examine an opportunity two things are needed. One person to create the opportunity and another to take it on. We are all familiar with the demands for equality in the second part - quotas for women on boards, more female film directors,  jobs for women, women's sports etc. When are we going to see equality in creating opportunities? When are we going to see women creating opportunities on the same scale as men do? Can you name an industry created and developed by women? Can you name  an institution created and developed by women? Can you name a major company created and developed by women? Can you name a major technology created and developed by women? Can you name a sport created and developed by women? When are going to see equal opportunities being offered to men?;0;0;1;1
51;My dad said he was being interviewed for a job by 7 woman and they asked him what he thought about feminism, female superiority and how men downplay woman in jobs and different career fields. I am a feminism but that is def toxic right there heâ€™s at a job interview it has nothing to do with it! Feminism isnâ€™t about female superiority itâ€™s about gender equality, raising woman to the same level as men, not above;0;0;1;1

55;Women being paid less then men for working the same job. Men get sentenced to jail for defending themselves when a women is first to hit the man. There certainly is gender inequality for both sides just different aspects.;0;1;0;1

65;Itâ€™s like saying I can get pregnant and u canâ€™t so itâ€™s your fault that I got pregnant and now are unable to do some things. I as a man wouldnâ€™t mind being able to produce another human but rn itâ€™s not scientifically possible so you canâ€™t just take the top spot because you are capable of doing something a man canâ€™t. So as a male I want to see the Daly the men have the same parental rights as a women.;0;0;1;1
66;So if a girl hits a guy a guy can hit her back;0;0;1;0
67;In the pursuit of achieving gender equality, the focus has often been on women: how to remove barriers for the inclusion of women, how to empower women, how to ensure that women gain access to health, economic, educational, and other opportunities. Since inequities are often created by unequal power dynamics between men and women, efforts that shift these dynamics, encourage behaviour change, and engage men and boys as allies, are central to making progress on Sustainable Development Goal 5: Achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls.;0;0;0;0
