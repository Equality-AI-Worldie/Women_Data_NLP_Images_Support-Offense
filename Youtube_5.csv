Hannah Reynolds,I have been harassed by 3 different men in three different instances. I am only 13. All of my girl friends including younger friends have been tops. This is not ok. Men and women should be safe.
"H,""Well,  last time I was sexually harassed in public it was by on duty police officers in a police van in around mid February this year. What makes it worse is that the individuals involved knew that I had just left an abusive relationship and had been reporting stalking and harassment from my ex partner."""
"HalTee,""I‚Äôm here cos of a PowerPoint they did in college, tbh I didn‚Äôt think it was this bad, Jesus."""
"Suzanne_RCDM,""I don‚Äôt feel secure on the streets of England, I have been assaulted when I was 16yrs as I was walking home."""
Nicola Douglas,The police need policing!!!! I've had awful treatment by police MEN!!! When I needed help!!!!
"Naps 187,""It's disappointing üòû to see men behaving like this, guys we need to protect our women imagine someone doing this to your sister, mother. We have a responsibility to change our behaviour"""
"Ji≈ô√≠ Kraj≈à√°k,""i did witness harassment on women multiple times over the years, of the touchy kind. one got shafted for rejecting the advances of the jackass in question. i'm with the girls on this one. they need legislative support"""
"Èõ∑ÊñáÈ≥≥,""So you‚Äôre saying that Cathy Newman of Channel 4 news listened well in her interview on Jan 16, 2018?"""
Benny Gpc,Welcome To The Freedom Land Of The World
Urahara‚Äôs Shop,Rushanara is my MP. That‚Äôs horrific
asha Say it,Needs to be more legislations for women in regards to these crimes on these streets
"Bobby Ranger,""There is a new bill that has been passed. It curbs protests and being a """"public nuisance"""". It also attacks gypsies and travellers."""
Smile Abdillaah,looking at the state of these women i could just imagine the men cat calling them.
Lee Hogg,At least channel 4 allows comments.    How can itv and other major media outlets expect a debate if comments are off.
"Mir Media,""Interesting how the deaths of ethnic minority women never seem to get the same level of attention let alone a protest a vigil or high court action. For example a Bengali bank worker was stabbed to death in broad daylight in Birmingham. It only made the local news whilst a missing white girl in Cornwall at the same time made national headlines. There is actually a name for this. Its called """"missing white women syndrome""""  Devamƒ±nƒ± oku"""
helen donohoe,So cruel the laws need to change
M R,Over 25% of the posts here come from one person ... a woman who works for the Russian state.
Gulam Choudhruy,Am 48 and I get harrassed by young girls so I  keep a beard now and it works.
Cassy Law,This happens on a weekly basis‚Ä¶. There needs to be a law to protect women in that way ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs ok to say hello or whatever but from you as a woman say no and it continues by verbal abuse or a stalking situation or even lead to be physically attacked this needs to be taken seriously so it can stop ‚úãüèΩ
