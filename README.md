This is a Sample, worked on by an intern from the University of Chicago for Worldie - Social Media for Good.
For your purposes, you will need to edit. This Sample has errors and is not perfect (requires tens of thousands of texts). 
- Collect the Data
- Label the Data (0-1 in labeled columns)
- Train from NLP packages on the internet
- Use an NLU tester page to see the result (attached example) and APIs

Important:
- Machines look at patterns of words, so the more data is trained, the more patterns it will recognize
- See the perspective from the female viewpoint and well-being
- Look at context (previous texts, texts afterwards, images, situation)
- Look at symbolism
- Look at semantics (meaning)
- Test your results of the processing with scientific methods in the context

Data is from Reddit and YouTube

<b>Examples -</b> We looked at specific case examples against women, e.g., on actresses, on women driving, domestic abuse, and other female-focused areas
