# Women Data ~ Labels to train NLP Text, NLU, Image Recognition AI with Support, Defense, Offense (YouTube & Reddit)

Texts & photos labeled of Support and Offense of Women for creating Equality AI, Natural Language Understanding, and image recognition protections for Women on social platforms. Done to accurately label defense of Women as "Support" and offense and defense against as "Offense." 

Shows 4 labels: support_women, defense_women, offense_women, defense_against_women

Previously data is not obtained about women or the abuse labels online did not classify about women accurately. E.g., Women's Defenders and Supporters were being labeled by NLP and by Sentiment as 'offenders' from open-source datasets.

This is a Sample, worked on by an intern from the University of Chicago for Worldie - Social Media for Good.
For your purposes, you will need to edit. This Sample has errors and is not perfect (requires tens of thousands of texts). 
- Collect the Data
- Label the Data (0-1 in labeled columns)
- Train from NLP packages on the internet
- Use an NLU tester page to see the result (attached example)

Important:
- Machines look at patterns of words, so the more data is trained, the more patterns it will recognize
- See the perspective from the female viewpoint and well-being
- Look at context (previous texts, texts afterwards, images, situation)
- Look at symbolism

Data is from Reddit and YouTube

Examples - We looked at specific case examples against women, e.g., on actresses, on women driving, domestic abuse, and other female-focused areas
