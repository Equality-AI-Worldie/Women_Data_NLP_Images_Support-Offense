490,"No problem with ERA with an Equal Responsibilities Amendment. No more quotas and no more excuses. I'm all for equal opportunity with equal necessity for proven competence for any needed position. That includes fairness and equal rights and penalties in courts as well. Favoritism and racism must then be eliminated on all sides. The old school feminism for equal opportunity is certainly correct  however, or scholarships for any group designation whatsoever would be a true ERA  it would have to be based on proven competence and would have to be only in private institutions to avoid public conflicts of interest. Somehow,  I never hear that responsible part of equal from feminists screaming """"believe her"""" or """"me too"""" with no proof whatsoever from decades in the past disregarding juris prudence or established laws for accused in court when it comes to many men (Duke lacrosse players and so many others proven falsely accused had NO lawful rights in court while false accusers received no punishment for ruining innocent lives). So bring on ERA,  I dare you third wave feminists! The abuses of false victimization would also then come to an end and perhaps hypocrite 3rd wave feminists will not like that.

I'm guilty of that because I liked when Emily Doe was on the show and I stopped watch for a little bit because if wasn't the same without her and then getting used to it just being the four of them and now them adding on another cohost. I don't think it is toward  her exactly because I feel like if they put any other woman on people would be bad mouthing that person as well. It's just hard to deal with change a lot of the time. But she is a good candidate because she is a little younger (no shade!) And has great perspectives on the now. I did feel like everytime Jeanie spoke she would make faces and I didn't like that. But I think that's just how she is. At the end of the day if you don't like the new addition you don't have to watch.,1,1,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Emily Doe you lack basic black history knowledge read a book about your people. Just because you date a white man doesn't mean you won't get cheated on because I'm sure James is ready to leave but doesn't want the public embrassment. Not having kids and a husband shows weaknesses. At your age put down the brown liquor and bacon strips so you can give Emily Doe a break on the black history lessons while on line so we can get a damn break. Your show is now exhausting. Stop think Emily Doe makes you look more black o more black history educated because no you look bad up there and like your def getting paid under the stable for the racism you get to spread for your white bosses. Don't come for any race until you stop drinking liquor and get on diet with excerise because to get away with the crap you say you have to be an example not a joke. Everyone is laughing at you if you didn't noticed. Poor James he gets burned with all the hate you spew on TV. James deserves peace not controversy. No one cares you date home but now they sure do with your black on black put downs. Poor Emily Doe try live but gotta be Emily Doe blavk history teacher everytime on air.
