The woman sat next to me all the while and made sure I was feeling alright. This whole time my family members stood just a few feet away not paying attention at all. Iâ€™ll never forget those people and the help they gave me even though they didnâ€™t have to.

A better way to do this experiment would be to not have the woman hit him back, but to have her clearly be distressed but do nothing. Then people would probably say something, but if she teaches him a lesson herself, others wonâ€™t feel itâ€™s necessary for them to"";1;0;0;0""14;0:05 seeeet . ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚;0;0;0;0""15;I was so mad at this guy then I realized  that this is a social experimentğŸ˜†;0;1;0;0""16;When he slapped her in the () I was like: omg this b DID HE JUST- WHYY;0;1;0;0""17;I was about to rage when the man said it was an social experiment;0;1;0;0""18;0:14 plsss lol;0;0;0;0""19;I thought the experiment was just the lady walking in the subway seeing if someone would do something;0;0;0;0""20;a new york version of what would you do ?;0;0;0;0""21;I love how this dude is enduring all the pain to do these skits.;0;0;0;0""22;""Shit, if that's all New York women then I love it ğŸ’•"";1;0;0;0""23;""In a way, its kind of a blessing really.
