# Women Datasets ~ Labels to train NLP, NLU, Image Recognition AI with Support, Defense, Offense

Texts & photos labeled of Support and Offense of Women for creating Equality AI, Natural Language Understanding, and image recognition protections on social platforms. Done to accurately label defense of Women as "Support" and offense and defense against as "Offense." 

Shows labels: support_gen, defense_gen, offense_gen, support_women, defense_women, defense_against_women

Previously data is not obtained at all about women or the abuse labels online did not classify about women accurately or at all. E.g., Women's defenders were being labeled by NLP as 'offenders.' We correct this.
