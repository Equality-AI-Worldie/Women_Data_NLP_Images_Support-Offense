id;text;Support_Women;Defense_Women;Offense_Women;Defense_Against_Women1;Im here for this new Tamera. More assertive and owning her voice;1;0;0;02;Let's not confuse hating and constructive criticism tho, 2 very different things.;0;0;0;03;Practice what you preachÉ;0;0;0;04;"Matthew 22: 37-39 ""Jesus replied: ""'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'""";0;0;0;05;I honestly believe this show has had so many ups and downs in regards to fans... they got hate when Tamar got fired... they got hate when there were only four hosts... theyâ€™re now in the stage of getting hate even though there are now five shots again... at this point they canâ€™t please anybody and are ok with that... not everything or everybody is for everybody and thatâ€™s ok... but the nastiness that comes with that is unnecessary and I think thatâ€™s what weâ€™re really expressing... thereâ€™s no need to put down someone because of a decision you donâ€™t agree with ;0;1;0;06;Esq.,Woman can be the absolute worst to other women. Itâ€™s really sad and pathetic. We need some healing frfr.;0;1;0;07;Does The Real Youtube staff ever have any days off? Posting on a Sunday but I am 100 percent here for it! ğŸ˜‚;0;0;0;08;I am loving Tamera's hair this season and how she is fully embracing that gorgeous natural hair. Go Tam Tam!!!;1;0;0;09;A tv one award show. This is the kind of topic that would never be discussed if Amanda wasn't there. Good or bad, but Amanda is leaving her mark.;0.5;0;0;010;We women need to support each other, lift each other up,not tear each other down.  I want all women to be successful in life no matter your race is.;1;1;0;011;I cant take Loni serious with this topic. She is known for being incredibly harsh to women;0;0.5;0.5;012;Last comment from Adrienne was on point!!;0;0;0;013;Seeing Missy, Kim and Brat is making me feel some type of nostalgic. Queen tingz.;0;0;0;014;Sometimes itâ€™s constructive criticism that people canâ€™t handle but other times its outright rude which I donâ€™t support;0;0;0;015;Women need to heal themselves and feel whole before they can uplift another woman. The most encouraging women are happy ones.;1;0.5;0.5;016;This show is constantly attacking other woman though. Like I'm a guy who enjoys listening to viewpoints and I enjoy(ed) this show for bringing mindsets that I'm not super familiar with. But they consistently go out of their way to put down any woman they disagree with. Not to harp on the lizzo situation, but that was a perfect example of them having no issue talking down to and even accusing someone of something simply because it disagreed with their own opinion. Amanda especially is very narcissistic at times and neither her or loni can take criticism well.;0;1;1;017;Women can support women and check them too. If a woman stands for something you don't, you don't have to nor shouldn't support her.;1;1;0;018;Yes Tam Tam! You have to also guard your heart and not focus on the negative comments. Amanda, you can't control people who are hurting or just plain awful which shows in their comments but you can control yourself so stop reading the comments if they bother you that much. The truth is that all other talk shows experience the same and sometimes worse experience with commenters. For example, I just happened to check out Wendy Williams comments and I must say there were more bad than good yet she keeps going. This is The Real and I must keep it real, you'll have got to develop thicker skins, guard your hearts and eyes and keep it pushing. Consider, the fans that love you and do it for them and yourselves. Y'all receive more good comments than bad so focus on that and spend less time going back and forth with people y'all don't even know. FYI, you would be shocked to know that some negative comments are from men but they use different picturesğŸ˜²ğŸ˜². I know that for a fact. Just saying. Let's all just keep saying and doing all the good we can to all the people we can and let God or karma, whatever you believe in, take care of the rest.;1;1;0;019;,Amanda knows the heat she was getting started way before The Real;0;0;0;020;Bringing in Jillian's daughter into Lizo's conversation about obesity wasn't exactly coming from the place of 'love'. Literally everyone agrees unanimously on the Twitter comment that touched the same topic, in both Twitter and YouTube comments. But the fact that Amanda was rudely playing a piano while it was being read was found very rude by everyone. There are actions and there are implications. And you cannot deflect the topic by focusing on the obvious wrong. Of course the nastiness is uncalled for, but you all know you are deflecting the real comments by choosing only the easiest victimising comments.;0;0;1;021;Its crazy bc Loni brought down Shan if i can recollect. they also brought down Julian which they were completely wrong for & when they got called out they are playing victim. Sometimes, its called constructive criticism just bc there are trolls who cant voice an opinion without being insulting doesnâ€™t mean the rest of us are wrong. Amanda, we donâ€™t hate you & I am not trying to bring you down but in that story you were wrong. I feel like you guys are running & claiming we are bringing hate which when i read the comments I saw criticism overweighed the hating and the trolling but i guess yall took it glass half empty. You guys get on people everyday for us voicing their opinion so why isnt it that yall just cant seem to get the point ? When you dont agree its on hate. We are not blind followers even tho we support and watch. Its okay to apologize when you are wrong thats all people were saying. Lets not dig deeper than needed.;0;0;1;022;,I get what you guys are saying but at the same time you have to differentiate constructive criticisms vs hate.;0;1;0;023;All the way from Africa women empowerment  #love ğŸ”±ğŸ’¯ğŸ”±;1;0;0;024;Facts, Tamera, Facts!ğŸ¤—;1;0;0;025;Having opinions doesnâ€™t mean â€œbeing in miseryâ€...lol.;0;0;0;026;€ Yes maaaaaammmğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚â¤ï¸â¤ï¸;1;0;0;027;Yes women should start lifting each other up all the time!

Women in the workforce, we can support ourselves pretty well now can't we?  I mean, a woman can choose a man because we love him, not just for his paycheck, right? ;0;0.5;1;037;I don't believe women compete as much as men do. I've seen and experienced women sticking with each other a lot more than men. Guys don't rush to each other's side the way we do. But hate is an individual thing, not a gender thing.;0;1;1;038;The woman that has been there for me is my self.;0;0;0;039;This is really random, but... has anyone noticed how white Adrienne's hand is?

Because itâ€™s not as simple as saying: â€œleave behind the people that take you down, focus on who loves youâ€. We are all a victim of the pull of that toxic competitive space between women. And we as women need to speak about it, identify it, understand where it comes from, and heal together.;1;1;0;065;I find Amanda worthy of being listened to, she is a great addition.

I even expressed my feelings about her addition in the comments...  And I just want to say how ashamed I am of that. Even though at the time I thought I meant it, but I actually don't dislike Amanda, I just disliked the change..  And for whatever its worth, I would like to show some new found respect for Amanda. It can't be easy to fit in with 4 other powerful queens and hold your crown high.;1;0;1;072;At first I didn't know what to think when Amanda joined The Real. From what I see, she's a great addition to the show and I love watching her and hear8ng her views. Btw Tamara is my ultimate favorite and I hope to meet you in person one day! Keep up the good work ladies;1;0;0;073;Lmfaooooo. @ loni checking herself because she was deff bouta make it about black women;0;0;0;074;"""That's so dope"". The only vocabulary Adrienne knows.

She is hands down my favorite!;1;0;0;080;The way to be supportive of other people is to stop being jealous.  Pray to be a better person and just stop competing.  there is nothing wrong with critique.;0;0;0;081;I love how the people in their audience and probably watching right not are like â€œYASSSSSS you go girl.

If Tamera is comfortable in that side of the table, then I'm ok with it. It took me a minute to get used to it!;1;0;0;084;Be sweet and kind but take no shit!,For real. All these bitter girls in COLLEGE are jealous of me because of the clothes I wear.... like obviously they donâ€™t care that much about fashion (most people donâ€™t) so they donâ€™t put all that much effort on themselves but yet they want to be rude and bitter to me? Pathetic! ğŸ˜† I stay wearing cute clothes though ğŸ¤—;0;0;1;085;,I think theyâ€™re trying to deflect a lot.. the YouTube comments arenâ€™t always coming from womanâ€™s insecurities theyâ€™re just FACTS;0;0;1;086;Im not there yet with complimenting women I'm jealous of or dont like. But I keep my jealousy to myself and dont spew hate. If i come across something/someone on the internet that i dont like or that threatens my ego, i just block it or turn it off. Its not that persons fault i got issues. I just pray God doesnt put me in situations where i have no choice but to be in close corners with someone unjustifiably hate. I still wouldnt be mean though(maybe a bit in my head). Id just be distant.;0;0;0;087;Shoutout to the women of the Real who choose to come out and inspire others through all the nastiness...to be honest I don't know how y'all do it, but it's admirable and that's why show continues the success it has.;1;0;0;088;Yes, Loni, YES!!! You caught yourself and did better - no divisions, just women! ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ‘ğŸ˜‰;1;0;0;089;I agree with Amanda. I use to loveeee reading the comment section of The Real but itâ€™s become soo nasty & hateful for no reason. I just write my comment and keep it pushing because the hate is disgusting for no reason.;0;0;0;090;If youâ€™ve seen how Amanda has put other women down, then you know how hypocritical she sounds here.;0;0;1;091;Competition come from negativity negativity is from jealousy, the jealousy that you just came in and already improved more faster than when we started in the same job. They are not being real. Women are emotional beings and jealousy is going to be a part of that, so therefore you can say uplift and empower and make her feel special and congratulate her on her improvements and accomplishments , yes when on the inside you are jealous of them getting all of that faster than you ever did. Adrienne, glad she said something about that, but to me that just sounds like what sheâ€™s saying is even though you are jealous on the inside congratulate that person (fake smile for that womanâ€™s accomplsihment.). Fake it till ya make it.;1;0;1;092;Please get Lilly Singh on the show ğŸ’—;0;0;0;093;Tell that to all the kids in school and to every medical student and to the nursing students that ask what score you got on your test just to be rude behind your backs.

It doesn't mean they hate you or think ill of you... That's what's wrong with these kind of television shows... They think everybody's supposed to take their advice and shut up... What's right for you is not always right for me... There's nothing wrong with everybody expressing their own opinion that's why God made us all different.... Different colors different eyes different hair we're all unique in one way or another... We don't live in a hunger games type of society.... So how can you sit up there and tell your viewers to be their self... But then get mad  because they have their own opinion...;0;0;0;095;Itâ€™s true about what Adrienne said but they compete with Nicki and cardi they are bias towards them itâ€™s obvious they chose cardi because they donâ€™t even praise Nicki like they do cardi imo;0;0;1;096;Look mane .. say what yawl want but Ms.Amanda is the perfect addition to this table . She speaks real truth !! She speaks facts ! She is educated !

Just be confident and secure in ourselves. Spin on a proverb ""Perfect love throws out fear"" to me is this";1;0;0;0104;The real is missing out on Tamar , Tamar was funny, outspoken, and just a natural but you could tell sometimes the girls didn't like Tamar maybe because she was so likeable to the audience and naturally the center of attention , loni has a control issue she wants to be the center but she's not it .;1;0;0;0105;Amanda was just was the real daytime neededğŸ’—ğŸ’—;1;0;0;0106;Speaking about women supporting women, I see you Loni, sporting Adrienne's XIXI jewelry collection ğŸ¥°ğŸ˜ I've seen just about all of them support Adrienne's earrings/jewelry and I love how they're actually friends and support each other.;1;0;0;0107;My take on this is besides the obvious ragging of Amanda, the problem goes beyond this platform. Women are just plain rude to other women. We gossip about each other constantly. We tend to have distrust towards each other (which I am very guilty of), we donâ€™t know how to have healthy relationships with each other. It is a problem. A problem that needs to be fixed because we are powerful beings and we should respect each other more because we share in the same struggle. Yet we spew so much hate to each other, it is hard to claw ourselves out of the pit society has dropped us in. When will it change. Me no know...;0;0;1;0108;So true Amanda some woman will never get this there even going to tear this post down;0;0;1;0109;I feel like the real got really political and focused on only problems that don't matter.

It frustrates me that we don't see where this energy comes from. Society used to be solely led by white men. This was legal, intentional, and written into the fabric of society. In the past, only select, very talented people could rise to the pinnacle of success. It was not an open platform. It was established that one woman met a quota and two were too much representation. We were not given the opportunity to lift one another without jeopardizing ourselves. So YES, support other women and minorities BUT also hold them accountable. OUR society cannot handle criticism and its damaging progress and evolution. Empowering women does not mean we should empower vapid behavior and decisions because that is not ""support"", it is enabling.";1;0;1;0115;Such hypocrites.

Lmao jk jk This is good ğŸ‘‘;0;0;1;0123;I would say out this panel Loni tends to put women down.;0;0;1;0.5124;I feel like a lot of people don't like change. As far as what Amanda was saying. I'm guilty of that because I liked when Tamar was on the show and I stopped watch for a little bit because if wasn't the same without her and then getting used to it just being the four of them and now them adding on another cohost. I don't think it is toward  her exactly because I feel like if they put any other woman on people would be bad mouthing that person as well. It's just hard to deal with change a lot of the time. But she is a good candidate because she is a little younger (no shade!) And has great perspectives on the now. I did feel like everytime Jeanie spoke she would make faces and I didn't like that. But I think that's just how she is. At the end of the day if you don't like the new addition you don't have to watch.;1;1;0;0125;Amanda f@ck the haters!!!! You are a great addition to this show!

That wasn't nice OR constructive and YOU put that out there. Stop playing the victim Amanda. It's not like we got angry for no reason. Letting slanderous accusations like that go unaddressed is setting a dangerous precedent where you can accuse someone of being a racist just because you dont like what they're saying. Now you're out here gaslighting the viewers who dont know what happened and making it sound like everyone criticizing you are just haters instead of having a valid reason to do so.;0;0;1;0134;So now men r the reason why women r competing against each other?;0;0;0;1135;WHATS WRONG WITH BEING COMPETITORS IN A COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY LIKE ENTERTAINMENT.

Hello Loni did you ever think how you made Jeanie feel when she is dating a black man Jeezy. Loni you lack basic black history knowledge read a book about your people. Just because you date a white man doesn't mean you won't get cheated on because I'm sure James is ready to leave but doesn't want the public embrassment. Not having kids and a husband shows weaknesses. At your age put down the brown liquor and bacon strips so you can give Amanda a break on the black history lessons while on line so we can get a damn break. Your show is now exhausting. Stop think Amanda makes you look more black o more black history educated because no you look bad up there and like your def getting paid under the stable for the racism you get to spread for your white bosses. Don't come for any race until you stop drinking liquor and get on diet with excerise because to get away with the crap you say you have to be an example not a joke. Everyone is laughing at you if you didn't noticed. Poor James he gets burned with all the hate you spew on TV. James deserves peace not controversy. No one cares you date home but now they sure do with your black on black put downs. Poor Amanda try live but gotta be Lonis blavk history teacher everytime on air. Don't worry Amanda you will get your peace soon.;0;1;0;0138;One thing I will say about women of color in NYC is they will compliment you on the street. No where else in the world have I had random women tell me my shoes, hair, makeup, etc is dope the way women in NY have. Probably not something you'd expect when you think of this city, but I promise you it makes me feel good every time, and has made me so much more likely to compliment women as well.;1;0;0;0139;Leave Amanda alone!!!! Yâ€™all already got my Tamar fired, now yâ€™all are after Amanda. Iâ€™m starting to think that some of these â€œso called fansâ€ just donâ€™t like educated, strong Black women or anyone that appears Black. This is the same hate Iâ€™ve experienced and so many others. But, we are not going anywhere. So, either get with the program, donâ€™t watch it, Or learn to share your viewpoints without being rude and nasty. The Real will be fine, they have other viewers besides all these negative ones.;0;1;0;0140;The real watchers werenâ€™t ready for the wokeness that IS Amanda âœŒğŸ¼ Lol she is a whole new level these ladies donâ€™t even understand yet. Thanks for adding her on!!!;1;0;0;0141;I mean regarding the critisim on Amanda in the comments, people fear intelligence and thats the only thing I see as a constant regarding Amanda in my opinion. Hope to see more of her views.;1;1;0;0142;You ok Amanda in all yall on the real dont let these negative comments get to u you because u keeping it real in they want sum sugar coated bs dont let that that change u or the way feel about things ğŸ¥°ğŸ™;1;1;0;0143;Amanda has Attitude issues ! Whats Up with those facial Expression .. Like a todler who cant Express themself outside of there EmotionÉ;0;0;1;0144;I do not enjoy women not supporting other women. All women should support each other because we all are beautiful Queens and deserve the best in life. We  as women should not see other women a competition. Remember no matter what it is;1;1;0;0145;I am sorry for you girls because you have veerryyy naaaastyyyy and mean fans;0;0;1;0146;Can Amanda wear another hair style?  Please just comb your hair.;0;0;1;0147;"Love Amanda Seales on the show. She brings a progressive edge to the table and challenges the status quo with logic and reasoning. Everyone should check out her podcast ""small doses"" for weekly truth gems by the way. She is the activist the Real needs.";1;0;0;0148;And here goes the hate in 5..4...3...2......;0;0;0;0149;Itâ€™s funny that they wanna preach â€œwomen supporting womenâ€... when all they do is bully ppl about their views unless they are  black !! Coming from someone who is black, these hosts hate other races especially white ppl for some reason... must be insecurity coming outğŸ¤«;0;0;1;0150;So yaull can start by letting white woman help take up for black rights because im pretty sure loni said at one point that she dont need no help from white women. Sooooo lets practice what you preach allll women should help eachother regardless of your race lets embrace eachother;1;0;0;0151;But TamerağŸ˜­you blocked me on IG for no reason.... all i asked was if you voted trump?!ğŸ˜”;0;0;0;0152;They should have an Indian female co host or an LGBTQ female presenter.;0;0;0;0153;The other side of that story u told.. https://youtu.be/pYbKmcZYL_8;0;0;0;0154;I think Amanda needs a whole new glam, wardrobe and hair squad she looks. Bit off;0;0;1;0155;women hate other women. they only come together against men.ğŸ™„ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚;0;0;1;0156;Yâ€™all can have opinions but not people in the comments ?;0;0;0;0157;Look donâ€™t care about what you people say just make sure the information is correct. And stop tormenting people with Inaccurate information posted on YouTube and donâ€™t get me started on useless sitcoms or movies onNetflix. You cannot just vomit words, do your research before making movies or  Move on to things you have knowledge of. Cause most people have. It is okay to close down the show if you have nothing authentic to contribute to entertainment.;0;0;1;0158;WTH WAS THAT FACE AMANDA WAS MAKING @ 0:58 !!  UGH..;0;0;1;0159;Loni is always looking at Amanda like a proud mama when she is speaking her truth! Yes ladies!;1;0;0;0160;I don't want to hear it I don't,You can't dismiss race when talking about women.;0;0;0;0161;Its really getting too serieus. Love the more casual girl chat. This is annoying. If i want something more serieus iâ€™ll watch the vieuw...ğŸ¤”ğŸ˜© sorry;0;0;0;0162;I feel bad cus they basically hate the black women on the panel, they go harder on black women then the other women, Jeannie and Adrienne have said some problematic stuff but everyone brushes it off. Let Tam, Loni or Amanda breathe and women attack them so harshly its deffo a race thing.;0;0.5;1;0163;Amanda, you rock. Donâ€™t listen to anyone but your heart.;1;1;0;0164;ğŸ—£ğŸ—£ğŸ—£Amanda the fans/viewers can CRITIQUE your opinions!!;0;0;0;0165;Ok, let me say something, I don't like the women need to support other women girl just because we both have a vagina doesn't mean, I gotta support you, I'll support you because your good person, I just, I never liked, that ever since, I was a kid,;0;0;1;0166;Why donâ€™t you just turn lesbian so you could be around women all the time;0;0;1;0167;I swear all Amanda does is complain the entire time and has made this show so boring!!!!!! She brings everything down into a negative space and talks about depressing things like isnâ€™t this supposed to be an entertainment show not the news. Iâ€™m sure Amanda is a nice person but I donâ€™t think she is a good fit on the show sorry.;0.5;0;1;0168;Amanda is Negative all negative f you mean???? Always talking about black girl this black people that like be inclusive;0;0;1;0169;First;0;0;0;0170;amanda dear.... we are trying to give you CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM , the fact you roll your eyes at the other hosts and make stank faces and playing violins while other try to make a point is RUDE AND CATTY and doesnt help your good points...  please accept our advice to you.;0;0;1;0171;I dont care, I still dont like Amanda on the show.;0;0;1;0172;The only thing that bugs me about Amanda isnâ€™t her opinions. Itâ€™s the fact is that most her opinions come off very condescending. Like, you can express your opinions without putting other people down for thereâ€™s and you can stop making faces when someone says something you donâ€™t agree with.;0;0;1;0173;We don't like you, Amanda. We want Tamar. She can never be replaced.;0;0;1;0174;I think Adrienne compliments Amanda because she is intimidated by her. You know how insecure and jealous women will constantly compliment you.;0;0;1;0175;I donâ€™t like her bring tamar back;0;0;1;0
