1;At age 60, I remember this all so well. And, I remember that most women were homemakers. Shopping, kids, cleaning, yard/gardening, cooking, entertaining the husbandâ€™s boss and clientele, helping cultivate community outreach, volunteered, attended church, members of PTA....on an on.  They were expected to act and present themselves in a certain way. Their husbands climbed the corporate ladder, many families â€œtransferredâ€ multiple times. Women acted as CEO of the household, budgeting and coordinating family events and Holidays. Go a step further, they are chauffeuring kids around to cheerleading, gymnastics, soccer, and making sure these kids were prepared for school, safe at the bus stop and did homework with the kids. Fast forward a few years.....do you know how many were taken care of OR taken advantage of? They were systematically divorced and traded in by their husbands for a younger woman. So how is this supposed to work, you are dumped, have no social security of your own, you were never compensated or really appreciated for your contribution. If you are one of the few that gets a reasonably fair deal, and some alimony for a limited time then you still have to navigate trying to keep your head above water, prices increase, medical care increases and women end up trying to work jobs at very low pay grades just to survive (not to mention dealing with corporate ageism). Women need to make the best most informed decisions, for every decision there is a positive or negative outcome. The world has changed greatly, but women are subject to the same BS we were in the 70â€™s. Women who want to be at home Momâ€™s should be celebrated, itâ€™s hard work. Always have a backup plan, access to your own money and keep up your skills and continuing education. There are programs to help women achieve, grants and such. Do what you can to protect your life, your rights and your freedom to VOTE!;0;1;0;0
2;I love how this show openly portrayed the complexities with Feminism and women's rights. People tend to group feminism into these reductive stereotypes, but the movement has a complicated history surrounding civil rights, abortion, and gay rights as not every person involved in the movement agreed on these positions.;1;0;0;0
3;I canâ€™t believe ERA still hasnâ€™t been passed by all of the states. What are people so afraid of?  Anyhoo...Just watched the series and itâ€™s great! Must watch!;1;0;0;0
4;I sometimes feel that people are so blind in one perspective that they comment as if the show was defending her or attacking ... ridiculous, from what I watched I believe they found a good tone.  It seems that these people didn't even watched.;1;0;0;0
5;"This comment section is a war zone.  I find that those whom feel the need to insult the ""other sides"" perspective beyond rational consideration of what's being said/debated are insecure with assessing their own beliefs in a critical manner, which is essential  when it comes to having a heart to heart mind to mind discussion on the problems at hand.";0;0;0;0
6;It's 2020 and we've still never had a female president or vice-president.  You've got a long way to go, baby....;0;1;0;0

8;Any time progress or equality is a with in reach conservatives step in to keep us all in the dark ages.;0;0;0;0
9;Hearing Rose's natural accent still surprises me;0;0;0;0
10;Wait, the ERA didn't pass?!!! WTF!!! I'm not kidding, I'm not american, I started to watch the show and I can't believe it. It's 2020 guys! what are you waiting for?  (btw spoilers);0;0;0;0
11;The way you want to live your life is your business. There are women that want to 'work' in their home as homemakers, and there are women who prefer to work outside the home. Neither is wrong or right. When, we, society, stop imposing our beliefs on other people, there will be no need for this type of dialogue. Bipartisanship will be obsolete. It's coming, and I hope I'm alive to see it. This IS the age of Aquarius....;0;1;0;0
12;I would love to see this topic be the next addressed in this country â™¡;0;0;0;0

15;Mrs. America is an excellent series â€” I Thoroughly enjoyed it.;1;0;0;0
16;Honestly leaving all the politics aside. What a bunch of badass women.;0;0;1;0
17;Excellent series.  I somehow missed it when it first came out a year ago, but just discovered it and binged it.  Watching this, you see how little has changed not just for women, but in politics.;1;0;0;0
18;Composite characters are always iffy;0;0;0;0
19;I'm in the UK, and I absolutely loved this series. Really cleverly written, the acting is awesome too. It was interesting from a historical point of view too, just knowing what those women did, and ultimately how similar they actually were. I also had no idea that this was still a thing...hopefully things like this series light a fire.;1;1;0;0
20;Great;0;0;0;0
21;Notice how all these lefty women couldnâ€™t take on the elegant lady, Phyllis Schlafly ðŸŒº Thank God for strong conservative women.;1;0;1;0
22;I remember ERA advocates promising that physical standards would be set that would keep women out of combat.;0;0;0;0
23;I love CBS Sunday Moning. Me and my girl try to catch it every week. I have to disagree with Kate Blanchet, i think history is damn entertaining in its own right. You get caught up in the story and, look at that, u leaned something;0;0;0;0
24;3/4 of states have already ratified it.;0;0;0;0

31;No one has ever been more oppressed than the modern white suburban female.;0;1;0;0
32;Betty Friedan was the wife of a big publisher, she had more help getting her voice heard than most.  She wasnâ€™t a housewife. What would the ERA do exactly?;0;0;0;0

35;What I love about this show is how it just tells the facts. There is no leaning towards right or left, just re-telling the story! Bravo!;0;0;0;0
36;I think it was dishonest of the show not to speak with Schlafly's daughter.  She would have corrected many of the inaccuracies which the show's producers clearly did not want to happen.  Those inaccuracies are basically on-ramps for modern feminists interested in either pouring hate on Schlafly or dismissing her as nothing more than a sympathetic figure surrounded by and controlled by the oppressive patriarchy.  This narrative isn't accurate but it makes for a compelling revision of history.;0;0;0;0
37;Is this schalfly womam not the one that said marital rape cant occur because the woman has signed herself to her husband, when they got married...ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚;0;0;1;0
38;Opression is opression. Plain and simple. I can't understand why ERA can't pass.;0;0;0;0
39;Carol Jenkins - name one poll that says that. Name one. Oh how the turn tables.;0;0;0;0
40;Everyone deserves Equality! No matter your race, gender, sexual orientation, etc. Its not about comparing anything to do with men to women its about whats equal is equal! Leave abortion out of it, the next lady having an abortion has nothing to do with me and my household, you make those kinds of decisions for yourself! Being a worker outside of the home, stay at home Mom/Wife (worker inside of the home), or both is something that we should all be able to chose for ourselves. But what it comes down to is I work just as hard as the next person so I should be paid equal, my rights should be equal, I should be treated equal! At the end of the day we are all human!;0;1;0;0
41;More left wing propaganda.  Women have all the rights of men.  People always get stuck the title of bills.  Equal rights so it must be good, letâ€™s pass it.  Remember, 99% of the time when government makes a law its going to take away some freedom and often had the opposite effect you intended;0;0;1;1
42;I STILL find it utter hilarious + ironic that Phyllis Schalfly had/has a Gay Son!  Talk about the irony, serves her right!  Lol;0;0;1;0
43;The false history is this series;0;0;0;0
44;I liked the part where they just completely rewrote the events of that debate to make it seem like the exact opposite thing happened.;0;0;0;0
45;Neither side mentioned woman in other countries. Who are treated terribly still. Like wear8ng Burkas. Or  girls nor be8ng able to go out without an escort  or go to school. I watched the woman's liberation movement in the 70 s was a 16 yr old . I didn't know how bad women were treated in other countries I would of liked to be educated about it back then.;0;1;0;0
46;This movie is historically inaccurate with an extreme liberal bent. If you want historical truth research the internet then watch the movie  and compare.;0;0;0;0
47;Itâ€™s interesting that they are acting as if this Hulu series is factual history of Schlafly(PS). I only could watch the 1st episode, because itâ€™s so inaccurate and obviously has an agenda. Like PS or not, this series is basically giving the exact opposite optics of what went on with PS. Rose Byrne just said PS was never home with her kids during all of this. Really? She had her last kid in 1964 or 65 and didnâ€™t take on the ERA until 1972. She home schooled all of her kids until they could read. They portrayed her in Mrs. America as leaning on her husband for her choices and finances. She sold 3m books from just 1 of I think 26 books she wrote just before taking on the ERA. Iâ€™m thinking that was a lot of income that SHE earned and in every biography her husband supported her decisions ðŸ’¯. They also portrayed a strained/resentful relationship with her mother. Just a complete lie. I watched a couple breakdowns of her debates of the show vs what really happened. The show spun them the exact opposite. Like she was unprepared and couldnâ€™t answer questions even panicking. This is an attempt to rewrite history. PS is being grossly misrepresented.;0;1;0;0
48;"""Don't name thirty. Just name one""  Even back then they couldn't give a straight answered.";0;0;0;0
49;Interesting show. Iâ€™ve watched many of the actual debates the show tries to reenact, the show doesnâ€™t do many of those justices. She was a Harvard educated lawyer, not some right wing hack. She believed that making men responsible for their families legally was important. The ERA does not justice for woman. There is still a wage gap in the states that have ratified it 40 years later.... the ERA was never about womanâ€™s rights, it was about the womanâ€™s opportunity to suppress the man.;0;0;0;1
50;What rights are women after that they donâ€™t already have? Do they finally want to be eligible for the draft?;0;0;1;0
51;The only thing the ERA will solidify is the handing over of more power to the federal government....;0;0;0;0
52;Love her!;1;0;0;0
53;"No problem with ERA with an Equal Responsibilities Amendment. No more quotas and no more excuses. I'm all for equal opportunity with equal necessity for proven competence for any needed position. That includes fairness and equal rights and penalties in courts as well. Favoritism and racism must then be eliminated on all sides. The old school feminism for equal opportunity is certainly correct  however, the recent 3rd wave feminists do NOT want equal rights but indeed want quotas, favoritism in court, blatant federal funds exclusively for being a woman (such as business ownership grants not afforded to males), and certainly do NOT want to be forced into military conscription at 18 years old like males. No more awards, nor grants, nor scholarships for any group designation whatsoever would be a true ERA  it would have to be based on proven competence and would have to be only in private institutions to avoid public conflicts of interest. Somehow, I never hear that responsible part of equal from feminists screaming ""believe her"" or ""me too"" with no proof whatsoever from decades in the past disregarding juris prudence or established laws for accused in court when it comes to many men (Duke lacrosse players and so many others proven falsely accused had NO lawful rights in court while false accusers received no punishment for ruining innocent lives). So bring on ERA, I dare you third wave feminists! The abuses of false victimization would also then come to an end and perhaps hypocrite 3rd wave feminists will not like that. True honorable women and men would love a bonafide equal and respectful world which would show the plethora of lies to all like unequal pay in 2020 which has several factors beyond false calls of unequal prejudice.";0;1;1;0.5
54;The show is full of lies and it is really disheartening;0;0;0;0
55;Cate Blanchett is much too attractive to play Phyllis Schlafly.;1;0;0.5;0
56;Phylis Schlafly was right !!!;1;0;0;0
57;The show lies ðŸ’¯.;0;0;0;0
58;€œIâ€™m a victimâ€ Nothing better than victim hood status these days. Thereâ€™s plenty archived to see this is an inaccurate portrayal. Whereâ€™s â€œMetooâ€ on Biden?;0;0;0;0
59;Not every woman wants the ERA tbh. It would be a night mare for many. Also men and women are not the same I donâ€™t understand whatâ€™s so hard to understand that. Why do women want to be the same as men? That has nothing to do with having equal opportunity, you want to be exactly seen as men thatâ€™s disgusting, I never seen so much women hate themselves and other women as well. I am so glad I am a woman and not a man, I donâ€™t want to be seen as being the same as a man, I love myself I love my gender I love womanhood if I can die and come back to life again it would be as a woman again.;1;1;1;0
60;Mrs America' contains blatant lies which are easily disproved.  It depicts Phylis Schlafly making up a court case when debating Brenda Feigen-Fasteau, when in fact it was Feigen-Fasteau who was caught making things up.  Brazen propaganda.  I wonder how many incurious viewers will go about their lives believing this show to be historically accurate.;0;0;0;0
61;"Gloria steinam ""didn't want to give her any air time"" 5:55 , have you seen Gloria in debate? she's horrible and Mrs. Schlafly would have wiped the flood with her.";0;0;1;0
62;The ERA failed because people know women already have equality under the law. It had nothing to offer women but it would have a bunch of negative side effects like getting rid of single sex schools, getting rid of womenâ€™s sports, mother/daughter father/son activities in schools, and forced drafting of women into the military if we get into WW3. the selective service system still gives the government the contingency plan to force fighting age men into combat if need be. ERA would force it to take young women as well.;0;1;0;0
63;But see its completely one sided.;0;0;0;0
64;Judging by the comments, people are getting wise to the feminist BS. Let women look at both sides accurately and decide for themselves.;0;0;1;0
65;Real Mrs America .com The Hulu show is full of lies.  Go watch the real Mrs. Schlafly and decide for yourself.;0;0;1;0
66;Shirley Chisholm was as thin as a rail. The actress playing her here...not so much.;0;0;1;0

70;Sadly the ERA is not going to help women.;0;0.5;0;0
71;"LOL, Steinem and Friedan didn't want to debate Schlafly anymore because they didn't want to give her anymore airtime...  Hah, You mean they were tired of getting their -sses kicked by a much smarter woman with real answers and facts.  And I don't think Phyllis was rude about it, she was just so much smarter and more prepared than the Feminists.  My favorite Phyllis line was ""I just don't understand why they would want a woman like Gloria who has never been married or had a child, talking about marriage and children.""  Classic.";1;0;0.5;0
72;Annoying!!! Phyllis Schafly was not at all as portrayed - she was a much more formidable and happy character. Disgraceful portrayal by this film. And we can check - as there is original footage. Just check that out.;1;0;0;0

74;This is an unfair and biased show against Ms. Phyllis.  There is very little truth to this show.  I'm glad this did not pass.;0;0;0;0
75;The ERA has flatlined. It is dead. Thank God for Phyllis Schlafly, a brilliant, articulate and classy woman.;1;0;0;0
76;Phyllis Schlafly was a true Christian, lady, and scholar! What a brilliant mind and a courageous heart.;1;0;0;0
77;Please no. Don't do this to women. We are not equal. We were never meant to be. Women cannot be expected to perform like men, and men cannot be expected to perform like women. It's not logical. I am terrified of what this legislation might be used to do.;0;1;0;1
78;Phyliss was a hero. The Netflix show about her life was dishonest to say the least. ERA has been renamed GAY RIGHTS ðŸ‘Ž;1;0;0;0
79;The ONLY ppl hurting women are these Godless, child hating women. They are proof that misery loves company. Now Gloria Steinen is pushing 90 and not a chick or child to so much as visit her. SO sad.;0;0;1;0
